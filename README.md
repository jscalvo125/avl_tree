# AVL Tree in Python   

This is an implementation of an AVL Tree in python for the sake of learning and also to provide a python library to handle these data structures.

Please not that the tree is tested to keep the AVL condition of a binary tree, but it is not tested to handle multiple objects.

Use it to compare same objects with comparable operators in place (int, bool, float, strings)


## How to use it?

Download the wheel file and install in your local, so you can import the avl_tree library.
